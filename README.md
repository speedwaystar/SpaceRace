## RP0 Tech Tree (for comparison)

* TIER 0 *** start: #TL-1 early tech. Sounding rockets, basic structural pieces and wings. Late 40s.
* TIER 1 *** basicRocketry: #TL0: Vanguard, early-mid 50s tech. Includes Black Arrow engines because they're late-50s vintage.
* TIER 2 *** generalRocketry: # TL1 Late 1950s/1960 tech, first real orbital LVs. Atlas, R-7, etc.
* TIER 3 *** advRocketry: # TL2 1960-65 tech or so. Gemini, Voskhod, etc.
* TIER 4 *** heavyRocketry: #TL3 Mid-late 60s tech. F-1, H-1 uprated, etc.
* TIER 5 *** heavierRocketry: #TL4 Apollo Applications program, N1F, etc.
* TIER 6 *** veryHeavyRocketry: #TL5 late 70s/80s tech, Shuttle / Energia era.
* TIER 7 *** experimentalRocketry: #TL6, late 80s/90s, Delta II, Atlas III, the first bits of EELV tech.
* TIER 8 *** giganticRocketry: #TL7, present day, Modern day tech.

## Road to KOSMOS Tree

* Tier 0 "Start", 1945+: Postwar sounding rockets. Basically, it's a A-4, the rocket, from which many space programs have begun its way. Assemble, stick an experiment and let it fly for peace!
* Tier 1 "Splitting up" 1950+: First national rockets. Early attempts at reaching space: Redstone and R-5 will be the main players, without capability to reach orbit, but able to reach further and touch the edge of space.
At that point, several branches form itself: USSR (which will split into three others later) and US (thanks to centralisation, it will be more "stable").
* Tier 2 "First satellite" 1956+: You may have guessed, it's R-7, and solid booster stages for your Redstone.
* Tier 3 "Man in space" 1960+: Vostok and Mercury hardware, including launchers and their alternatives.
* Tier 4 "Back in numbers" 1965+: Gemini and early Soyuz hardware. 
* Tier 5 "Mun or bust" 1967+: Saturn and N-1. 'Nuff said, those monsters are well-known to anyone
* Tier 6 "New frontiers" 1970+: Space stations and alternative programs: fly me to the Duna or build mine ice on Minmus!
* Tier 7 "Reusable Space Program" 1980+: Space shuttles, basically, and Energia launcher.
* Tier 8 "Reach for the planets" 1990+: Angara, PPTS, Orion... So many opportunities!
* Tier 9 "Joining efforts" 2000+: Technologies, that enable cross-docking capabilities, and allow to make Kerbalkind united.
* Tier 10 "United we stand" 2015+: Finally merging branches and advancing into space as one: large orbital constructions, resource collection etc... NB, that part will be remade later for KAA-like stuff
